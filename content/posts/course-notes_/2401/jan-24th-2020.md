You can make an array that has 20 spots, but populate only 3 (or however many less than 21 you want)

`%zu` is how you print out the output of the sizeof() function.

Using sizeof() on an array gives you back the number of bytes that it takes up, not the number of elements.
To get the number of elements, do: sizeof(array)/sizeof(<type>) where <type> is the type of the variable.
This means there's no way of knowing how many items you put into an array, only the number it can store.

2D arrays can be accessed as 1D arrays.

Example:
` int array[2][3] = {[1,2,3],[4,5,6]}`
`array[0]` would give you `[1,2,3]`

### Defining a class:
1. struct method
 - struct Name { define the variables and methods };
 - to initialize a new object: struct Name thing;
2. typedef method
 - typedef struct { define the variables and methods } Name;
 - to initialize a new object: Name thing

Using the typedef method is good since you don't have to type struct when creating a new object.

__ A pointer takes up 8 bytes. __

Sometimes more bytes get added to structs (called padding) in order to make them multiples of 2, 4, or 8.
^ clarified more in the class notes.

Setting values of an object's variables is pretty much the same as most other languages we encountered.
i.e. dot notation
` object.attribute = 5`
