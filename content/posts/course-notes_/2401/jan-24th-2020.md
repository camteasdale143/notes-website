# Intro to Systems Programming

### January 24th, 2020

2 out of the 3 tests are counted.
Test 1 is on Wednesday, Jan 29th.


You can make an array that has 20 spots, but populate only 3 (or however many less than 21 you want)

`%zu` is how you print out the output of the sizeof() function.

Using sizeof() on an array gives you back the number of bytes that it takes up, not the number of elements.
To get the number of elements, do: 
```C
sizeof(array)/sizeof(<type>)
```
where `<type>` is the type of the variable.
This means there's no inherent way of knowing how many items you put into an array, only the number it can store.

2D arrays can be accessed as 1D arrays.

Example:
```C
int array[2][3] = {[1,2,3],[4,5,6]};
array[0] == [1,2,3];
 ```

### Defining a class:
1. struct method
```C
struct Name { 
    // define the variables and methods 
};
struct Name variable_name; // to initialize a new object 
```
2. typedef method
```C
typedef struct { 
    // define the variables and methods 
} Name;
Name variable_name; // to initialize a new object
```

Using the typedef method is good since you don't have to type struct when creating a new object.

#### A pointer takes up 8 bytes.

Sometimes more bytes get added to structs (called padding) in order to make them multiples of 2, 4, or 8.
^ clarified more in Mark's notes.

Setting/accessing an object's variables is pretty much the same as most other languages we encountered.
i.e. dot notation
```C
object.attribute = 5;
```
