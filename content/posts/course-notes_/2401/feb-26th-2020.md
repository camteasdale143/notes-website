### Function pointers
 - pointers that point to a function
 - Why do this?
  - to process data in a variety of ways(printing a record of a linked list, comparing 2 records...)
  - Create general purpose code that is independent of the data type (sorting, binary trees, linked lists...)

#### How to declare a function pointer:
 - void (\*fPtr)(int, float);
 - genaral form: (return type)(variable name)(parameters)
