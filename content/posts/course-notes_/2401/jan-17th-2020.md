### Bit Models:
 - nibble = half a byte = 4 bits
 - right side = insignificant (of a byte)
 - left side = significant
 - A byte can only store a number less than 256, numbers greater than that need more bytes

### Two's compliment model:
 - How C represents negative numbers
 - Steps to convert positive to negative:
  1. flip bits
  2. add 1
