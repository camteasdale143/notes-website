### January 8th, 2020

_Mark Lanthier_

- C and Java are the top programming languages used today

Stuff we will cover:
-linked lists
-pointers
-memory management
-threads, processing
-organizing code
-file IO
-little bit of graphics

___OBJECTIVE OF COURSE: LEARN C___

`Programming != Systems Programming`

This is a crucial course to do well in

### END OF INTRO

Systems Programming is the programming of software that provides services for other software ... or for the underlying computer system

The goal of system software is to make efficient use of resources

An Operating System is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs

Applications make system calls to the operating system, operating system makes memalocs (memory allocations) 

Function calls - resources - hand wavy things

## What an OS does:
- File IO
- Device IO
- Process Management => what gets processed where
- Virtual memory
- Scheduling

The language of choice for programming an OS is: C

Shells:
A shell is a cli that allows access to an operating system's services
- sh - Bourne shell
- bash - Bourne-again shell
- csh - C shell

- man --- manual
- cd - change directory
- rmdir - remove directory
- mkdir - make directory

A Debugger is a program that is used to test and debug other programs

In Conclusion: C is scary

First C program: Hello World

To run a program:

`gcc -o [program_name] [c_file_name.c]`

## STRING FORMATTERS:
- `%d for integers`
- `%f for floats`
- `%u - unsigned integers`
- `%g - float with 6 digits`
- `%c - characters`
- `%s - string`
- `%x - hex`

numbers after % sign to declare spaces

`%.numberf` to declare decimal accuracy

`%-` is left align

when in doubt, man printf in console
