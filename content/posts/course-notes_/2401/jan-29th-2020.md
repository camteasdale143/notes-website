# Intro to Systems Programming

### January 29th, 2020

_--- Test 1 is today, lecture is half as long ---_

 - Chapter 3 is probably the most important chapter

### Union:
 - like a struct, except everything takes up the same spot in memory
 - a union takes up as much space as its largest element
 - can be an efficient way to store multiple values in less space (smaller values)
 - ordered in "Little Endian Byte Order" --> left-most bit is the least significant
 - structs can be put into unions
 
### Pointers:
 - variables that stores a memory address
 - pointers take up 8 or 4 bytes (depending if the system is 32 or 64 bit)
 - it's how variables/objects are passed to functions behind the scenes in Java
 - declaration: [type] *name;
 - derefrencing: getting the value at that address, done by putting a * in front of the pointer
