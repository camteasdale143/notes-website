# Intro to Systems Programming

### January 29th, 2020

Test 1 is today, lecture is half as long

 - "Chapter 3 is probably the most important chapter" -Mark Lanthier

### Union:
 - like a struct, except everything takes up the same spot in memory
 - a union takes up as much space as its largest element
 - can be an efficient way to store multiple values in less space (smaller values)
 - ordered in "Little Endian Byte Order" i.e. left-most bit is the least significant
 - structs can be put into unions
 
### Pointers:
 - variable type that stores a memory address
 - pointers take up 4 or 8 bytes, depending if the system is 32 or 64 bit (it's 8 in our case, 64 bit machines)
 - it's how variables/objects are passed to functions behind the scenes in Java
 - declaration: 
 ```C
type *name; // where type is the type of object/variable that the pointer is pointing to
 ```
 - derefrencing: getting the value at that address, done by putting a * in front of the pointer
