No booleans, use chars instead (0 - false, 1/anything else - true)
You can use the `!` (not) operator on chars when using them as booleans

#### Ternary operators exist! 
```C
tired? printf("tired\n") : printf("not tired\n");
```
However, simple if else statemets look nicer and are more readable.

for and while loops are the same as java.

do/while loops are while loops where it goes through the loop and then checks.

`-lm` when running gcc to use the math library.

### Random numbers:
```C
#include <stdlib.h>
double value = rand()/(double)RAND_MAX; // to get a random value between 0 and 1.
```

to get 'true' randomness, use the time.
```C
#include <time.h>
srand(time(NULL)); // time(NULL) gives you the current time.
```
