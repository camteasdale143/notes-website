No booleans, use chars instead (0 - false, 1/anything else - true)
You can use the `!` (not) operator on chars when using them as `booleans`

#### Ternary operators exist! 
- `tired? printf("tired\n") : printf("not tired\n");`
However, simple if else statemets look nicer and are more readable.

for and while loops are the same as java.

do/while loops are while loops where it goes through the loop and then checks.

`-lm` when running gcc to use the math library.

### Random numbers:
`> double value = rand()/(double)RAND_MAX;` to get a random valuve between 0 and 1.

_^ need to use <stdlib.h>_

to get 'true' randomness, use the time.
```
#include <time.h>
srand(time(NULL)); // time(NULL) gives you the current time.
```
