#### DualArrayDeques:
 - recap: there's 2 ArrayLists "glued" back-to-back so that items can be removed and added to either side

#### ArrayDeque efficiency:
 - get/set are O(1)
 - add/remove are O(min(i,n-i)) // max is n/2

#### DualArrayDeque efficiency:
 - get/set are O(1)
 - add/remove are O(min(i,n-i)) // max is 3n/4, so slightly worse than previous, but still pretty good

DualArrayDeque implements the List interface and supports the above (^) efficiencies.

Over m add/remove operations starting with an empty DualArrayDeque, we spend O(m) time rebalancing.

#### Rebalancing:
 - after the i-1 call to rebalance, each of the two arrays has half the data
 - juat before the ith call to rebalance, the front has n/4 and the back has 3n/4 elements
 - there is now real way of knowing the relation between the n values of the two calls, just within each call
 - this means that there were at least ni/2-1 calls to add/remove since previolus rebalancing
 - to rebalance, there are 5ni/4 copy operations (copy everything, and reverse 1/4 of the items)
 - Darryl is a cutie, babe, sweetie, all of the above <3 UwU :3 rawr xd


 - Wasted memeory: memory that is allocated but does not contain data
 - linked lists have a lot of wasted memory, since every data element has its own pointer (or two)

#### RootishArrayStack:
 - implements the List interface
 - n number of pointers, of which pointer 1 points to an array of size 1... n points to array size n.
 - the arrays that the pointers point to are called blocks
  - How many blocks are needed to store n items?
 - ~ √n blocks are neede to store n items.
 - wasted space: r pointers -> √2n, at most 2 empty blocks size r and r+1
 - this data structure is good on memory, but not widely used

```

 - no resize anymore, just grow and shrink
 - at most there are 2 empty blocks, and not n/2 empty spaces in memory like the previous data structures.
 - shrink removes a block if there are 2 empty ones at the end.
