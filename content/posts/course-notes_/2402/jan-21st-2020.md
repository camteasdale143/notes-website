Searching: Phonebook - book with everyone's name in alphabetical order

Search algorithm: linear search - start at the beginning and look through every entry until you get to the end/find the person.
Efficiency: O(n)

### Search algorithm: binarySearch(list, key, low, high)
	list - array of names
	key - element we want to find
	low, high - look between these two indexes
With this algorithm, you start at the middle(between low and high), look at the element and determine if it comes before
or after the element we're trying to find. Discard stuff after if it comes before, or before if it comes after...
Repeat.
```
T(n) - number of memory accesses to search n items.
T(n) = T(n/2) + 2 (after every iteration)
     = T(n/4) + 2 + 2
     = T(n/8) + 2 + 2 + 2
     .
     .
     .
     = T(n/2^k) + 2*k (after k times, where n/2^k = 1)
 ```

`log n = k`

__Efficiency of this binary search: 2+2log n = O(log n)__

An iterator is the same as a for loop, except when you "iterate" over something, the iterator gives you the actual
element of the array/list/hash/whataver you're looking through.

A hashset has O(1), which is why you should use it for phonebook-like work.

## ArrayStack (ArrayList in Java) - data structure backed by an array and implements stack and list interface.

### Interface:
- Stack interface:
 - push(x) - puts x on "top"
 - pop() - returns and removes the top of stack
 - size() - returns the number of items
- List interface:
 - get(i) - return item at index i
 - set(i,x) - return element at i, insert x at index i
 - add(i,x) - insert x at index i, re-indexing all elements at positions >i
 - remove(i) - return the element at i, shift items at pos. >i "left" (back one index)

### Implementation: ---coding---

### Analysis(ignore resize): 

All three functions in the stack interface have O(1).\\

### List interface:
- get(i) : O(1)
- set(i,x) : O(1)
- add(i,x) : O(n-i)
- remove(i) : O(n-i)
