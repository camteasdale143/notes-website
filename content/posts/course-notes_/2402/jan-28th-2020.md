SSSC Coding Challenge Thursday @ 6pm

Assingment 2 has been posted, will be discussed more in class over the coming days/week.
Part 2 is making a linked list

ArrayDeque (continued):
 - Implemented with a circular array
 - to resize: double the size of the array and copy everything over
```
>resize():
>  T[]b=new Array(Math.max(1,2*n))
>  for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
>    b[i]=a[(j+i)%a.length] // j is the class array index (index of a[])
>  }
>  a=b
```
List Interface (ArrayDeque)
```
> get(i): return a[(j+i)%a.length];
> set(i,x):
>   T y=a[(j+i)%a.length]
>   a[(j+i)%a.length]=x
>   return y
```
### Retro

```

 - ArrayDeque implements the list interface
 - ignoring calls to resize, it supports:
		get(i),set(i,x) in O(1) time
		add(i,x),remove(i) in O(min(i,n-i)) (moves n/2 items at most) (previously was O(n-1))
 - starting with an empty ArrayDeque, any series of m calls to add/remove results
	in O(m) time spent in resize()
 - ArrayDeque isn't used too often, but it is used in assignment 2
 - if you need a queue, might aswell make it an ArrayDeque (double ended queue)
 
### ArrayDeque uses:
 - Parallel computing load balancing job distribution
 - undo/redo functions, since it can be used as a stack, with the ability to remove things from the back
	when lots of actions are performed in order to free up memory.

### Other ways to implement and ArrayDeque:
 - Linked list (although they can be pretty slow)
 - 2 ArrayStacks back-to-back (so that you can remove from either side)

DualArrayDeque:
```
       0 1 2 3|4 5 6  <- desired indexes
  | | |a|b|c|d|e|f|g| | | 
       3 2 1 0|0 1 2  <- actual indexes of the two lists/arrays

>		boolean add(i,x){
>			if(i<front.size){
>				front.add(front.size()-i,x); // different from get() due to how indexes work out
>			} else {
>				back.add(i-front.size(),x);
>			}
>		}
>		T remove(i) {
>			// basically the same as get() and set()
>		}
>		int size() {
>			return front.size+back.size;
>		}
```
 - what hasn't been addressed yet is how to keep the front and back in balance,
	since for this to work the front and back must have things in them in order to keep efficiency.
 - every time we add or remove something, also call rebalance().
````
>	void rebalance(){
>		if(size()>1){
>			if(front.size*3<back.size){  // resizes if one side has only a quarter of the total data
>				int s = size/2;
>				List<T> si, sz = new Stack();
>				si.addAll(back.subList(0,s));
>				Collections.reverese(si);
>				si.addAll(front);
>				sz.adAll(back.sublist(s.size()));
```
