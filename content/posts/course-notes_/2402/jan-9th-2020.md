Data structures => Interface, Implementation, Analysis

## INTERFACES

x-data element

i-index

#### Queue interface:
- add(x) - adds x to the data structure (DS)
- remove() - removes an element from the DS according to the dueuing discipline

#### First in/first out queue (FIFO)
- data items that have been there the longest get 'served' first
- remove() removes the data that has been there the longest
- think of it as a line at a store

#### Last in/first out queue (LIFO)
- aka stack
- push(x) <=> add(x)
- pop() <=> remove() - removes the item that has been there the shortest(last item added)
- think of it as a stack of dishes

#### Priority queue
- you can think of all of these as priority queues, only differs what is prioritized
- we define what we mean by priority (aka arbitrary)
- remove() removes data with "highest" priority
- a heap is typically used to implement this (more on heaps later)

#### Double-ended queue (Deque, pronounced deck)
- enqueue(x) <=> add(x)
- dequeue() <=> remove() (semantic)
- Abstraction of LIFO and FIFO (both at the same time)
- addFirst(x), addLast(x)
- removeFirst(), removeLast()
- arbitrarily pick a first side and a last side (implicit sequence)
- you can implement LIFO or FIFO using a Deque

#### List inteface
- get(i) - returns the data element at index i
- *set(i, x) - replaces element y at index i with element x, and returns y *
- add(i, x) - 'moves' all items after index i over, and sets index i to element x
  - changes the index of everything that follows by 1 (basically)
  - with linked lists, it just gets spliced in
- remove(i) - removes element x, and "shifts" everything after it back
  - again, with a linked list, nothing moves, it would just get skipped
- addFirst(x) => add(0, x)
- addLast(x) => add(size(), x)
- removeFirst() => remove(0)
- removeLast() => remove(size()-1)

#### In addition, all interfaces implement size() which returns the number of elements in the database.

### SETS

#### Unordered set interface (USet)
- add(x) - if x is not in the DS, we insert it
- remove(x) - if x is in the DS, we remove it
- find(x) - find element y that's equal to x, and return y or null if y does not exist
- (In java, == looks at memory location, whereas .equals() looks at the data the elements store)

#### Ordered set interface (OSet)
- find(x) - returns the least element y, such that y>=x, or null if y does not exist
- add(x) and remove(x) are the same as USet
- data elements must have a total order in order to compare the values

#### Dictionary 
- is a key-value pair
- DON'T USE THE JAVA DICTIONARY CLASS FOR THIS
- use the map interface in java
  - Map <K,V>
