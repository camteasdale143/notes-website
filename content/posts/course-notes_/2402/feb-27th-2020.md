## SkipLists (cont.?)
### Analysis of SkipLists
 - expected height: log(n) where n is the number of items in the list (refer to recap for explanation)
 - expected size/memory: 3n (2n for pointers since average node is $L_1$, plus n items)
 - expected length of search path: O(log n)

### Recap:
 - flip coin to get the height of a node; if heads, add a "level", if tails, stop adding
 - heads with prob of 1/2, same with tails
 - in general, if there are n elements, we expect half to be promoted to ($L_1$ in latex)
 - this general rule continues through the levels, making the expected height log(n) (base 2)

### Expected size & length calculations
 - Let T be the number of times a fair coin is tossed up to an including the first time it comes up tails
#### Claim: $E[T] = 2$
 - Indicator random variable $I_i = 0$ if the coin is tossed $< i$ times, $1$ if the coin is tossed $i$ times or more
 - $I_i = 1$ if and only if the first $i-1$ coin tosses are heads
 - $P[I_i=1] = 1/(2^{(i-1)})$ (P = probability)
 - $E[T] = E[\Sigma_{i=1}^\infty(I_i)]$
 - = $\Sigma_{i=1}^\infty(1/2^{i-1})$
 - = $1+1/2+1/4... = 2$
 - Therefore, the expected height of any given node is 1 (heads and then tails)
\\
 - Expected length of L_r $0 < r < \infty$
 - Let $I_i,r = 0$ if $L_r$ does not contain the ith element, 1 if $L_r$ contains the ith element
 - in other words, $i$ is the index of a node, $r$ is the level of that node
 - if $I_i,r = 0:$ the node is not at that level, if 1 then it is
 - $E[|L_r|] = \Sigma_{i=1}^\infty(E[I_i,r]) = n/(2^r)$
 #### Claim: Expected height of skiplist containing n elements $= log(n) + 2$
 #### Claim expected length of a search path is $2log(n) + O(1)$
 - Lemma: expected number of steps right at a given level r is 1
 - $S_r = $steps to the right
 - $E[S_r] \le 1, S_r \le L_r$
 - $E[S_r] \le E[|L_r|]$
 - $E[Steps] = E[h+\Sigma_{r=0}^{\infty} S_r]$
 - $E[Steps] = E[h] + \Sigma_{r=0}^{floor(log(n))}(1) + \Sigma_{r=floor(log(n))}^{\infty}(n/(2^r))$
 - $E[Steps] = E[h] + log(n)+1 + (1/2+1/4+1/8...)$
 - $E[Steps] = E[h] + log(n)+1 + 2$ <- 2 not 1 because we ignored the floor function and that adds 1 to the result
 - $E[Steps] = O(log n)$

### Conclusion:
 - SkipLists implement get, set, add, remove, find in $O(log(n))$ operations/time


## HashTables
 - How fast is add/remove/find for a set of integers $\{1..n\}$ and an array of length n?
 - HashTables can do this in O(1) time
```java
boolean find(T x){
	return a[hashcode(x)]==x;
}
```
### Chained HashTable
 - buckets are Lists(i.e. it's an array of lists)

```java
public ChainedHashTable<T>{
	List<T>[]t;
	int n; // number of items in the hashtable
	protected final int hash(Object x){} // returns an integer {0..t.length-1}
}
```
 - maintain n <= t.length, so that the average number of elements per location is <=1
 - it also gives us a good distribution to avoid collisions (hashing 2 different things returns the same index)
 - implement the USet interface: find/add/remove

```java
boolean add(T x){
	if(find(x)!=null)
		return false; // x already exists
	if(n+1>t.length)
		resize(); // make the array bigger
	t[hashcode(x)].add(x);
	n++;
	return true;
}
T remove(T x){
	Iterator<T>it = t[hashcode(x)].iterator();
	while(it.hasNext()){
		T y = it.next;
		if(y.equals(x)){
			it.remove();
			n--;
			return y;
		}
	}
}
```
