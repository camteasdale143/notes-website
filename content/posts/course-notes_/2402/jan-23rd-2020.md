ArrayStack:
- implements List interface
- get, set, size, run in O(n) time
- add, remove run in O(n-i) time (not including calls to resize)

Amortized Analysis:
- average running time (one way to think about it)
- found by averaging high cost method calls over low cost method calls (usually)

```
resize():
    T[] b = new Array(Math.max(1,2*n)) // 2n memory accesses (although this is less clear, since it can vary greatly)
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
	b[i] = a[i]; // 2 mem accesses
    }
    a = b;
∑(0 to n-1)(2) = 2n (the for loop)
```

__A call to resize requires 4n memory accesses.__

Example: call add(x) n times where we resize to n.

`∑(1 to n)(i) = (n(n+1))/2 = O(n^2)`


#### Calls to resize():
- add: if(n=a.length) resize();
- remove: if(a.length>=3*n) resize();

Furthermore, starting with an empty ArrayStack and making m add or remove operations
results in O(m) time spent in resize.

`ni = number of elements in the ArrayStack during the i'th call to resize()`
`ai = length of the array just after the i'th call to resize()`
`Therefore: ai = ni * 2`

just after i-1 call to resize, length = ai - 1 (array is half full)

just before the i'th call to resize, ni = ai - 1 (array is full)

between these two cases there were at least ni/2 calls to add.

### Queue Interface (FIFO):
- an array is not good for implementing a queue, since removing/adding things to/from the front
	takes a while, since everything else needs to be shifted over.

### ArrayDeque:
- double ended queue
- Deque interface:
    - addFront()
    - addBack()
    - removeFront()
    - removeBack()
- using addFront()/removeBack() makes a queue.
- adding and removing from both sides should be quick.

### Implementations:
Infinite array method
```
 | | | |a|b|c|d|e|f| | | |  <--- array with data in the middle
       j^           <---- pointer to the front, and we keep track of the number of things in the array
Interface:
addLast(x) - a[j+n] = x; n++;
removeLast() - if(n<=0) return null;
	       T temp = a[j+n-1]; a[j+n-1] = null; n--; return temp;
addFirst(x) - a[--j] = x; n++;
removeFirst() - if(n<=0) return null;
		T temp = a[j]; a[j++] = null; n--; return temp;
```
To make an "infinite" array, we can make a "circular" one (basically python arrays)

% function in java only really works on positive numbers since with negatives it returns a negative number.
