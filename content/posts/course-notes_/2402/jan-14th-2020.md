Deadline for the assignment is midnight, but try to submit by 10:30 ish

Node`<Integer>` does not inherit from Node`<Number>` even though Integer does inherit from Number.
This means that a function that takes a LinkedList`<Number>` can't take a LinkedList`<Integer>`.
If you want a node to only take Number, you can do:

`> public class Node<T extends Number>{...}`

Likewise, this can be done for any class:

`> public class Node<T extends Student>{...}`

In the above case, you can pass in a variable that "is a" Student, which means it EITHER extends or implements Student.

String, Number, Double, and Integer already implement the comparable interface (but int does not).

Interface Comparator`<T>` is similar to the Comparable interface, except it takes 2 arguments in its .compare(..) method,
and it also has a .sort(..) method.

## Binary Trees:
Lots of different types(sorted, red-black...)

### Explanations of $\Sigma$ notation and Logarithmic functions 

`ln(n) ≈ 0.69 log(base 2)(n)`

### Explanation of Big O notation 

Expected value = average value over "infinite" iterations


`E[x}=∑(xeX)x * Pr(X=x) (possible value times probability of getting that value)`

### Cost of an algorithm:
 - memory accesses <- what we care about the most (highest cost, i.e. array[i])
 - comparison operations

Steps of swapping two elements of an array:

`> temp = array[i]`

`> array[i] = array[j]`

`> array[j] = temp`

Cost: 4 memory accesses (temp does not count), 3 in java?

### Selection sort explanation 
 - after n iterations, n items are sorted.
