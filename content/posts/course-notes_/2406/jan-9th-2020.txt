Javascript is one of the core technologies of the web
Allows for dynamic web pages
Also now used for server-side programming
both client- and server-side will be done in this course

JS lets you do things that don't make sense
easy to miss mistakes

"just because you can doesn't mean you should"

JS does not have general IO support for network, storage...

> console.log("Hello World");

Node.js & Chrome will be used in this course

> $ node some_file.js <-- runs the file from the terminal

<script> [JS stuff] </script>
or
<script src="filename.js"></script>
in your HTML file

Putting it at the bottom is good because the HTML will load first and the user will see something while the JS is loading
Top means blank page while JS loads

Not talking about user input because we don't get a lot of it, besides stuff being clicked

Keywords for making variables:
-> let
-> const (constants)
-> var (don't use this one)

scoping rules: everything is defined only within its block

var has no block scope, only function scope. DON'T USE IT

Hoisting: JS moves some declarations to the top of their scope, which means you can use a variable before it's defined

x=5;
var x;
